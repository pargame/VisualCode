# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. The repository uses a
lightweight workflow:

- Fork the repository or create a branch from `main`.
- Make changes on a feature branch and ensure lint, format and tests pass.
- Open a Pull Request describing the change and link any related issue.
- PRs should include: description, testing steps, and CI status.

Pre-PR checklist:

- Run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` locally.
- Add tests for new behavior and run `npm run test -- --run`.
- Ensure no secrets are committed.
