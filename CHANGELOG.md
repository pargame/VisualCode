## [Unreleased]

- YYYY-MM-DD: Fix node placement when clicking while board is scrolled â€” click coordinates now include board scroll offsets so nodes snap to grid correctly.
- 2025-08-24: Upgrade dependencies to latest stable where safe (React 19, ESLint 9 flat config, Husky 9). See PR #11.
  - Release asset: VisualCode-dist-v0.0.1-deps-20250824.zip
